<b><u>About Me</u></b>
</div>

<b><center>Personal Info:</center></b>My name is Kyle, I have a pet cat named Milo, and a fox-terrier named Trixie, I’ve lived on the Gold Coast my whole life and have far too many hobbies I often jump around from, though to name my longest running and those I consider passions, 
they are video-games, music, bodybuilding, and watching basketball, where I support the Philadelphia 76ers<br>

<b><center>Interest in IT:</center></b>- Interests in videogames and technology stemmed from my childhood, I owned a PlayStation 2 and found myself spending hours upon hours using it, when I was thirteen however, I started to take interest in computer games, and from there 
I further developed my interest in not only games, but computer programs.<br>- My experience in IT is fairly barebones, my schools IT classes were not taught by very knowledgeable teachers, often my teacher (who was the head of IT) required help from the students, 
and those who weren’t gifted in understanding computers were left behind, as a result. Unfortunately, this resulted in me not enjoying learning IT as a didn't have the proper technique nor drive to self-learn. Instead, most of my knowledge is from computing as a hobby, rather than from an institution.
<br>- I chose to enroll in IT at RMIT to test the waters, and to see if I would like the subject, this was suggested to me by an advisor from OUA.
<br>- I’m expecting to learn the foundations of IT that I can further build upon before deciding on my particular field of study in the subject. I am most interested in programming as a subject.<br><br>
<b><center>Ideal Job:<br><a href="idealjob.pdf" target="_blank">Games Programmer</a></center></b>
- Video Games have always been a constant in my life, and during these times of playing, I’ve always had an interest in working in the industry that has helped entertain me throughout the years. I also particularly like the option of creating your own games as an indie developer/studio.
as well as the creative involvement video-game development entails.<br>
- The skills I’d need to acquire to obtain this position would include a proficiency in C# programming, as well as a familiarity of the Unity game engine.<br>
- Currently, I have learnt a small amount of C#, however it’s nowhere near enough to be proficient so I will need to continue learning that language. As for Unity, I have messed around in it but never quite stuck to learning it fully, I intend to familiarise myself further.<br>
To obtain these skills in C# and Unity, I’d like to turn game development into a hobby that I can enjoy and not consider neither work nor study.<br><br>

<b><center>Test Results and Thoughts:</center></b>
Tests determining one’s personality can be a fun conversation or way to connect with people, however I don’t believe one should rely too heavily on these results, as these tests cannot ever be entirely truthful, as people can knowingly or subconsciously lie to the tests, 
undervalue or overvalue certain aspects, and overall, simply answer in ways that can benefit them. I find the MBIT and Big Five test to be more entertainment than a judgement of character, however, that doesn’t mean there aren’t some truths in the results.<br><br>
Having a good balance between both logical and emotional thinking is beneficial in a workplace environment, as it allows one to perform well in team-based scenarios. Using emotional thinking to understand other team members emotions allows one to get along better with coworkers and work better in 
team-based scenarios and projects, while the logical thinking allows one to perform tasks in the most logical manner when need not factor in emotions. Though introversion is one of the most prominent traits I received in the MBIT, I do believe this introversion affects meeting new people 
and interacting with others that which I don’t know, once in a group of people I know, this introversion practically disappears.<br>
Having my learning style be auditory/visual benefits me as I am able to be shown the proper way in which to do a task, before understanding and then said task.<br><br>
When forming a team, I believe it best I get to know the group members firsthand before beginning on the task at hand. Understanding how people work and their personalities can benefit the projects’ ability to develop and is best worked on with a team that understands each other.<br> 
While I don’t think I’m the type to sit back and let everything be decided for me, I also don’t believe I should lead but instead contribute an equal amount to the conversation and the ideas the team have come forward with.
